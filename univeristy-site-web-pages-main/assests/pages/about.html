    <section class="content">
        <div class="col-1">
            <h3 style="margin-top:15px">Dear Recruiters,</h3>

            <p class="text">
              The National School of Engineers of Sousse (ENISo) is a Tunisian engineering school that is part of the University of Sousse.
              Its goal is to meet the growing national need for engineers specialized in cutting-edge industries. With its three programs, research masters,
               and professional master's degree, it trains engineers in industrial computer science, mechatronics, and industrial electronics.
              Founded in July 2005, the ENISo was first located on Avenue du 18-Janvier in the Bab Jedid district of Sousse,
               before moving to the Sousse technopole in the fall of 2011, near the business incubator.
            </p>


            <p class="text">
             <h3><b>Training</b></h3><br>

              The ENISo trains engineers with versatile skills through three programs.<br><br>
              
             <b>Mechantronics</b><br>
              
              The mechatronics engineer is a multidisciplinary engineer, competent in the fields of mechanical engineering, computer science, automation, and electronics. Among the sectors of activity of these engineers are the automotive, aerospace, robotics, industrial production machine tools, etc.
              
              The mechatronics section offers two options in the third year:<br>
              
              -Mechanical system design<br>
              -Aerotechnics.<br><br>
              <b>Industrial electronics</b><br>
              The industrial electronics program offers three different options in the third year:<br>

              -Industrial control<br>
              -Electronic system design;<br>
              -Embedded electronic system.<br>
              The engineer is generally competent in the fields of electronics, automation, and electrical systems.<br><br>
             <b>Applied computer science</b><br>

              The applied computer engineer is a developer engineer, a process engineer, competent in the field of embedded computing.

              This section offers three options in the third year:<br>

              -Distributed systems engineering;<br>
              -Advanced robotics;<br>
              -Embedded communication systems.<br><br>
            </p>

            <p class="text">

              <h3><b>Doctoral Education</b></h3><br>
              <b>Professional Master's</b><br>
              The professional master's degree in industrial and manufacturing engineering is part of the LMD system, co-constructed (M2) in partnership with national industrialists. The objective is to train industrial manager engineers, with the ability to lead quality improvement projects on a technical level or human resources management and manage production and organization systems.
              
              The courses taught are taught by industrial experts and partner companies. A second session of the master's was opened in March 2013,
               following the success of the first session.
              
              Three other masters co-constructed with European universities have obtained the approval of the scientific council and that of the University of Sousse
              
              (Mastech, Applied Computational Mechanics, Composites and Polymers) and is scheduled to start in September 2013. 
            </p>



            <p class="text">

             <b>Research Masters</b><br>

              In the framework of the LMD system, the research master (M1 and M2) is carried out in parallel with the basic training of ENISo engineers to allow them to obtain a double degree
              . Students enrolled in one of the ENISo masters are required to attend an additional volume of hours to that validated in their basic training.<br>
              Currently, there are four research masters:Mechanical and Systems Engineering,Industrial Informatics,Telecom Engineering,Intelligent Knowledge Engineering



            <p class="text">

              <b>Research</b><br>

              To facilitate the work of researchers, ENISo has two research structures<br>
              The Laboratoire de Mécanique et d'Ingénierie des Systèmes (LMEIS): is dedicated to research in the fields of mechanics, systems engineering,
               and mechatronics.<br>

The Laboratoire d'Informatique Appliquée à l'Industrie (LIAI): is dedicated to research in the fields of industrial informatics,
 computer science, and artificial intelligence.
